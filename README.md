# Face Recognition 

File ```face_rec.py``` is just a copy from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5moAA31iTmM&t=665s).

File ```face_rec_multiple.py``` checks to see if the deteced face in frame matches any image present in the folder named "faces"

File ```face_rec_pickle.py``` loads image data from files by using the pickle module. (Faster version of ```face_rec_multiple.py```)
